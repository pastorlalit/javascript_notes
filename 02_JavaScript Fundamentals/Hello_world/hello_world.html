  <p>Before the script...</p>

  <script>
    //JavaScript programs can be inserted almost anywhere into an HTML document using the <script> tag.
    // The type attribute: <script type=…>
    // The old HTML standard, HTML4, required a script to have a type. Usually it was type="text/javascript". It’s not required anymore. Also, the modern HTML standard totally changed the meaning of this attribute. Now, it can be used for JavaScript modules. But that’s an advanced topic, we’ll talk about modules in another part of the tutorial.
    // The language attribute: <script language=…>
    // This attribute was meant to show the language of the script. This attribute no longer makes sense because JavaScript is the default language. There is no need to use it.
    alert( 'Hello, world!' );
